## Mando-Voice
A specialized text-to-speech model trained on The Mandalorian's voice using OuteTTS-0.2-500M. This repository contains the complete workflow to create your own Mandalorian voice model, allowing you to generate speech with the distinctive vocal characteristics of the iconic Star Wars character.
Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the OuteTTS-0.2-500M model to mimic the voice of The Mandalorian from Star Wars. By following this guide, you'll be able to create a text-to-speech model that captures the unique vocal qualities of Din Djarin.
